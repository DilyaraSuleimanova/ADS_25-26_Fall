/*Jonathan the Poet has finished his new poem recently. But something went wrong and now he thinks that rhyme could be better. He believes that applying cyclic shift by K positions will fix the problem. Jonathanâ€™s new poem is a sequential list of words. Jonathan is tired and asked your help to find such cyclic shift.

To clarify, you are given a poem of N words as a single linked list. Your task is to write function that shifts linked list by K positions and returns the head of new linked list.
